Abstract: Post-cardiac surgery pain affects patients, family caregivers and nurses. The pain experiences of patients, caregivers and nurses remain largely unknown. Therefore, it is important to examine the experiences of patients, caregivers and nurses in depth to ensure effective pain management. The aim of this study is to examine post-cardiac surgery pain from the perspectives of patients, caregivers and nurses. A descriptive qualitative research design was used. The study was carried out in the cardiovascular surgery ward of a tertiary hospital in Türkiye between June and December 2022. The data-driven triangulation method was used in the research. The study sample consisted of eight patients who had undergone cardiac surgery in the tertiary hospital, eight family caregivers and nine nurses who provided care for these individuals. A 'semi-structured interview form' was used to collect data through face-to-face and in-depth interviews. The data were analysed using the thematic analysis method. The COREQ checklist was used for reporting the study. As a result of the interviews, six themes were elicited from the data. These themes were 'explaining pain', 'assessment of pain', 'responses to pain', 'effect of pain on activities of daily living', 'expectations in painful situations' and 'pain management'. This study revealed the differences between pain perceptions and coping processes of patients who experienced pain after cardiac surgery, their caregivers and nurses. Considering the experiences of patients, caregivers and nurses in pain management after cardiac surgery, applications that will ensure joint participation in care practices should be planned.
