Abstract: In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment in patients with functional dysphonia, the Cepstral Peak Prominence (CPP) test was used. Twenty dysphonic women aged from 18 to 47 years were under observation. The control group consisted of 20 healthy women of close age. Patients underwent 5-7 sessions electrostimulation of laryngeal muscles and phonopedic treatment, after which a complete restoration of the voice was noted. The Praat clinical program was used, installed on a Hewlett-Packard 630 laptop (Pentium B960, 2.2 GHz). A SHURE SM94 condenser microphone was used as well. In the control group, the results were as follows: <i>M</i>=7.49 (<i>SD</i>=1.26) dB. In the main group before treatment: <i>M</i>=5.00 (<i>SD</i>=1.07) dB, after treatment: <i>M</i>=7.95 (<i>SD</i>=1.34) dB. Differences in KT values in the main group before and after treatment (5.00 dB and 7.95 dB, respectively) were significant at <i>p</i><0.0001. Differences in KT values in the main group before treatment (5.00 dB) and in the control group (7.49 dB) were significant at <i>p</i><0.0001. Differences in KT values in the main group after treatment (7.95 dB) and in the control group (7.49 dB) were not significant at <i>p</i>>0.05. The study showed high sensitivity of the method. The CPP data after treatment were higher than those before treatment and did not differ from the control ones. It is concluded that CPP is a highly sensitive method for evaluating the degree of periodicity of an acoustic signal and can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment in patients with functional dysphonia.
