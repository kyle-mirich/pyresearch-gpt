Abstract: Post-cardiac surgery pain affects patients, family caregivers and nurses. The pain experiences of patients, caregivers and nurses remain largely unknown. Therefore, it is important to examine the experiences of patients, caregivers and nurses in depth to ensure effective pain management. The aim of this study is to examine post-cardiac surgery pain from the perspectives of patients, caregivers and nurses. A descriptive qualitative research design was used. The study was carried out in the cardiovascular surgery ward of a tertiary hospital in Türkiye between June and December 2022. The data-driven triangulation method was used in the research. The study sample consisted of eight patients who had undergone cardiac surgery in the tertiary hospital, eight family caregivers and nine nurses who provided care for these individuals. A 'semi-structured interview form' was used to collect data through face-to-face and in-depth interviews. The data were analysed using the thematic analysis method. The COREQ checklist was used for reporting the study. As a result of the interviews, six themes were elicited from the data. These themes were 'explaining pain', 'assessment of pain', 'responses to pain', 'effect of pain on activities of daily living', 'expectations in painful situations' and 'pain management'. This study revealed the differences between pain perceptions and coping processes of patients who experienced pain after cardiac surgery, their caregivers and nurses. Considering the experiences of patients, caregivers and nurses in pain management after cardiac surgery, applications that will ensure joint participation in care practices should be planned.


Title: Machines meet humans on the social road: Risk implications.

Abstract: Human drivers and machine drivers (i.e., automated vehicles or AVs) will share roads and interact with each other, creating mixed traffic. In this perspective, we develop two mental models about them and their social interactions, aiming to understand the risk implications of AVs and mixed traffic. Based on Mental Model I (i.e., machine drivers are superior drivers without human weaknesses), many simulation-based safety assessments, which often overlook or oversimplify human-AV social interactions, have predicted significant safety benefits when machine drivers interact with or replace human drivers. In contrast, Mental Model II considers human and machine drivers as heterogeneous and incompatible, suggesting that their interactions may lead to unexpected and occasionally negative outcomes, particularly in imminent mixed traffic. This perspective gains support from recent comparative empirical studies that employ various methods such as survey experiments, driving simulators, test-tracks, on-road observations, and AV accident analysis. These studies provide initial evidence of emerging traffic risks arising from human-AV social interactions, including human drivers' aggression and road rage toward AVs, human drivers exploiting AVs, AVs exerting negative peer influences on human drivers, and their incompatibility increasing human drivers' challenges in joining mixed traffic and thus risky behaviors. We propose specific suggestions to mitigate problematic human-AV social interactions and the associated emerging risks.

Abstract: In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment in patients with functional dysphonia, the Cepstral Peak Prominence (CPP) test was used. Twenty dysphonic women aged from 18 to 47 years were under observation. The control group consisted of 20 healthy women of close age. Patients underwent 5-7 sessions electrostimulation of laryngeal muscles and phonopedic treatment, after which a complete restoration of the voice was noted. The Praat clinical program was used, installed on a Hewlett-Packard 630 laptop (Pentium B960, 2.2 GHz). A SHURE SM94 condenser microphone was used as well. In the control group, the results were as follows: <i>M</i>=7.49 (<i>SD</i>=1.26) dB. In the main group before treatment: <i>M</i>=5.00 (<i>SD</i>=1.07) dB, after treatment: <i>M</i>=7.95 (<i>SD</i>=1.34) dB. Differences in KT values in the main group before and after treatment (5.00 dB and 7.95 dB, respectively) were significant at <i>p</i><0.0001. Differences in KT values in the main group before treatment (5.00 dB) and in the control group (7.49 dB) were significant at <i>p</i><0.0001. Differences in KT values in the main group after treatment (7.95 dB) and in the control group (7.49 dB) were not significant at <i>p</i>>0.05. The study showed high sensitivity of the method. The CPP data after treatment were higher than those before treatment and did not differ from the control ones. It is concluded that CPP is a highly sensitive method for evaluating the degree of periodicity of an acoustic signal and can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment in patients with functional dysphonia.

Abstract: The issues of epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, diagnostics and clinic of acute catarrhal rhinosinusitis are considered, the possibility of using the herbal medicinal product Sinupret extract in the treatment of patients with acute viral rhinosinusitis is substantiated. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of using the drug Sinupret extract in patients with acute viral rhinosinusitis. A comparative study of the efficacy and safety of clinical use in patients of the drug Sinupret extract in patients with acute viral rhinosinusitis was carried out in comparison with symptomatic treatment. After analyzing and processing the results obtained using statistical methods for the main group, a faster rate of decrease in the severity of complaints (data with the use of the MSS visual analogue scale), the severity of inflammation in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx, the amount of discharge from the nose and its viscosity were confirmed. Restoration of respiratory function according to rhinomanometry and mucociliary transport according to the results of the saccharin test also occurred more quickly in patients of the main group compared to the control group. The effectiveness of using Sinupret extract is also confirmed by the results of photoplethysmography. The use of the drug Sinupret extract not only contributes to a more rapid improvement in the general well-being of patients and a decrease in the severity of complaints, but also leads to an improvement in the objective picture of the disease (rhinoscopy, the results of anterior active rhinomanometry, saccharin test) compared with the control group, favorably affects the quality life of patients, causes a decrease in economic and social costs against the background of the development of acute viral rhinosinusitis.
